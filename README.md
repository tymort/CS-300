# CS-300
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
I needed to implement a data structure for storing, sorting, and printing course results from a text file.
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I first defined the requirements of my program and where priorities needed to be focused such as sort speed. I then examined the different data structures and their run time efficiency. After deciding the best approach, I created pseudocode in te selected data structure, binary trees.
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I was able to overcome a majority of my roadblocks through the use of StackOverflow, ZyBooks, and my professor. Each of these sources gave me simple suggestions and places to look to fix my code. I then took these basic ideas and formed them to fit my use case.
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This has expanded my approach to designing software as it gives me a better idea for selecting my own path. Usually for projects like this, everything is already very predetermined, however, in this example I was able to select my data structure and it required me to optimize for efficiency and the user's needs.
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project has evolved my program readability and maintainability as the number of unique errors I encountered were greatly aided by readable code. By keeping my code easy to read and understand, it was very simple to fix and debug. As such, I know the imprtance of keeping things readable.
